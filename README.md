Elman networks and time series modelling

In Matlab an Elman network can be created using function newelm as follows (type “help newelm” in command window for help in detail):

<pre>            newelm(input,target,[N1,...,N(K-1)])</pre>

where input and output represent the input and target of training set, [N1, …, N(K-1)] denote the number of units of each hidden layer (as the number of units of output layer is determined by target).

The demo code models the seriesx 0.75×2 0.2x (x x 1) using Elman n n1 n2 1 2
